## **FAQs**

**What's the biggest difference between Contabo VPS and Vultr Cloud Compute?**

The biggest difference lies in their core value proposition: Contabo offers massive raw server resources (CPU, RAM, storage) for exceptionally low prices, targeting budget-first users. Vultr provides a high-performance, developer-friendly cloud platform with a vast global network, extensive API, and a broader ecosystem of services, focusing on flexibility and scalability.

**Which is cheaper for a VPS: Contabo or Vultr?**
   
For a given amount of raw CPU cores and RAM, Contabo is almost always significantly cheaper. For instance, a Contabo plan might offer 4-8GB RAM for the price Vultr charges for 1-2GB. However, Vultr offers smaller, cheaper entry-level plans (like $2.50/mo IPv6 only) that Contabo doesn't match at the very low end.

**Does Vultr offer NVMe storage like Contabo?**

Yes, Vultr's standard Cloud Compute instances use 100% NVMe SSDs, which is a key performance feature. Contabo also offers NVMe options for its Cloud VPS plans, in addition to standard SSDs.

**How does Vultr's global network compare to Contabo's?**
   
Vultr has a significantly larger and more strategically distributed global network, boasting 32+ data center locations worldwide. Contabo also offers global locations but not as extensively as Vultr. This makes Vultr potentially better for applications requiring minimal latency to a very diverse global audience.

**Is Vultr or Contabo more developer-friendly?**
   
Vultr is distinctly more developer-friendly. It offers a robust API, CLI tools, one-click application deployments, custom ISO uploads, and a platform designed for automation and integration with developer workflows. Contabo provides root access and some API functionality but lacks the extensive developer ecosystem of Vultr.

**Can I get hourly billing with Contabo VPS like with Vultr?**

No, Contabo primarily offers monthly billing for its VPS plans. Vultr is well-known for its flexible hourly billing across its Cloud Compute instances, which is beneficial for short-term projects, testing, or dynamic scaling.

**What about additional cloud services like Object Storage or Load Balancers?**

Vultr offers a comprehensive suite of additional cloud services that integrate with their compute instances, including Object Storage, Block Storage, Load Balancers, CDN, Managed Databases, and Kubernetes (VKE). Contabo also offers Object Storage, but its ecosystem of interconnected cloud services is less extensive than Vultr's.

**Which provider is better for beginners to VPS hosting?**

Neither is strictly "beginner-friendly" in the sense of managed hosting. Both offer unmanaged servers requiring technical knowledge. However, Vultr's intuitive control panel, extensive documentation, one-click apps, and active community might make it slightly less daunting for someone new to cloud server management compared to Contabo's more basic interface.

**If I need a VPS with a very large amount of SSD storage, who is better?**

Contabo's "Storage VPS" line is specifically designed for this, offering multi-terabyte SSD capacities at very low prices, making it a clear winner if massive local SSD storage on a budget is your primary need. Vultr offers scalable Block Storage, but it's an add-on and can become more expensive for very large dedicated volumes compared to Contabo's integrated Storage VPS.

**What about DDoS Protection?**

Both providers offer DDoS protection. Contabo includes basic DDoS protection. Vultr also provides DDoS mitigation and allows for more advanced configurations and options for protecting applications from attacks, often integrated with its broader network services.

## **Conclusion**

In the Contabo vs Vultr, both providers offer solid hosting services with unique strengths. Contabo stands out with its affordable pricing and generous resource allocations, making it ideal for budget-conscious users seeking value.

Vultr, on the other hand, shines with its high-speed performance, global data centers, and developer-friendly features, catering well to users prioritizing speed and scalability.

Choosing between them depends on your specific needs—Contabo is great for hosting multiple projects cost-effectively, while Vultr is better for performance-driven applications and global reach.

Ultimately, both are reliable choices. Your decision should align with your project requirements, technical preferences, and budget.
